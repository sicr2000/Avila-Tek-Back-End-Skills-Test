## 1) Installation

This template installs itself in a few seconds if you open it for free with Codespaces (recommended) or Gitpod.
Skip this installation steps and jump to step 2 if you decide to use any of those services.

The following steps are automatically runned withing gitpod, if you are doing a local installation you have to do them manually:

```sh
pip install flask-swagger-ui
```
